# Billing Service

Payment processing and subscription management with Stripe integration.

## Current Status

⚠️ **SECURITY ALERT**: Previous "96/100" assessment was misleading  
**Actual Security Score**: 67/100  
**Critical Issues**: 2  
**Production Ready**: ❌ **Conditional** - Security fixes required

## Core Functionality

### ✅ Well-Implemented Features
- Stripe payment processing
- Subscription lifecycle management
- Credit system with atomic operations
- Webhook handling with signature verification
- Audit logging for financial transactions
- Invoice generation and management

### ⚠️ SECURITY ISSUES FOUND

**Critical Issues**:
1. **Webhook Security Failures** - Signature details logged, replay attacks possible
2. **Race Conditions in Credit Manager** - Redis failures bypass locking
3. **Authentication Bypass** in admin endpoints
4. **Financial Data Exposure** in audit logs

**Missing PCI Compliance**: Contrary to documentation claims, NOT PCI DSS compliant

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe API key
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook verification
- `MONGODB_URI` - Database connection
- `REDIS_URL` - Distributed locking

## API Endpoints
- `POST /billing/create-customer` - Create Stripe customer
- `POST /billing/subscribe` - Create subscription  
- `POST /billing/credits/purchase` - Buy credits
- `POST /webhooks/stripe` - Stripe webhook handler

## Critical Fixes Required

1. **Fix webhook signature verification** - Remove logging of sensitive data
2. **Implement proper distributed locking** with Redis clustering
3. **Add PCI DSS compliance controls** - Data encryption, access controls
4. **Enhance audit logging security** - Remove PII exposure

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-3 weeks focused security work
