   - **Examples:** MongoDB regex without sanitization

2. **Authentication Bypasses**
   - **Service:** Knowledge Service
   - **Risk:** Unauthorized data access
   - **Issue:** Document upload endpoints lack authentication

3. **Race Conditions**
   - **Service:** API Gateway
   - **Risk:** Data corruption, duplicate resources
   - **Example:** Project name uniqueness check

### 🟢 Medium Priority

1. **Information Disclosure**
   - **Services:** Multiple
   - **Risk:** System fingerprinting
   - **Issue:** Verbose error messages

2. **Event Bus Security**
   - **Services:** All
   - **Risk:** Inter-service communication interception
   - **Issue:** Redis lacks authentication

## 🐛 Critical Bugs & Missing Implementations

### Fake/Mock Implementations in Production

1. **Cognitive Core Learning System**
   ```javascript
   // 95% of learning system returns mock data
   return {
     recommendation: 'scale_up',
     confidence: 0.95,
     reasoning: 'Mock scaling recommendation'
   };
   ```

2. **User Management Audit Logs**
   ```javascript
   // Admin routes show fake audit data
   const auditLog = {
     entries: [], // Should query real audit collection
     // ...placeholder data
   };
   ```

3. **Flow Service Analytics**
   ```javascript
   // Analytics endpoints return hardcoded data
   analytics: {
     views: 0,
     collaborators: []  // Should be real metrics
   }
   ```

### Missing Error Handling

- Uncaught promise rejections in AI provider calls
- Database connection pool exhaustion not handled
- WebSocket connection cleanup may be incomplete
