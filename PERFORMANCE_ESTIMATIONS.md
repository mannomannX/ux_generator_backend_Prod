Error Rate: < 0.1%
WebSocket Connection Count: < 80% of limit
Credit Consumption Rate: Monitor for anomalies
```

## üéØ Realistic Expectations

### What the System CAN Handle Well
- 500-1,000 concurrent users with good performance
- 10,000 daily active users
- 100 AI requests per minute (total)
- 1,000 flow saves per minute
- 2,000 WebSocket connections

### What Will Cause Problems
- Sudden viral growth (10x users overnight)
- Large enterprise deployments (>100 concurrent AI requests)
- Complex flows with >1000 nodes
- Real-time collaboration with >50 users per flow
- Bulk operations on >10,000 records

## üí° Key Recommendations

1. **Start with conservative estimates**: Plan for 500 concurrent users initially
2. **Monitor actively**: Set up alerts before reaching 70% capacity
3. **Scale gradually**: Add resources incrementally based on actual usage
4. **Optimize first**: Many bottlenecks can be resolved through optimization
5. **Have a runbook**: Document procedures for common scaling scenarios

## üìù Conclusion

The UX Flow Engine in its current form is well-suited for:
- **Small to medium businesses** (50-500 employees)
- **Startups and growing companies**
- **Teams of 5-50 designers**

To handle enterprise-scale deployments (10,000+ concurrent users), significant infrastructure investments and architectural changes would be required, particularly around AI processing capacity and database scaling.

**Most Realistic Scenario**: The system will comfortably handle 500-1,000 concurrent users with the current architecture, providing good performance and reliability. Scaling beyond this will require the optimizations outlined above.
