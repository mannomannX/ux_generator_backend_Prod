# Flow Editor Improvements - Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ Completed Improvements

### 1. **Optimized Auto-Layout Algorithm**
- Horizontal layouts now use side connections (left/right) when nodes are aligned
- Vertical layouts use top/bottom connections appropriately
- Smart handle assignment based on relative node positions

### 2. **Multi-directional Edge System**
- Nodes support connections from all 4 sides (top, right, bottom, left)
- Dynamic port activation based on connections
- Visual indicators for port types:
  - Green = Output
  - Blue = Input
  - Purple = Bidirectional

### 3. **Improved Edge Popup (Screen-relative)**
- Edge popup now stays at fixed screen position regardless of canvas zoom
- Compact icon-based design:
  - üè∑Ô∏è Tag icon for label editing
  - ‚ÜóÔ∏è Different icons for edge styles
  - ‚ùå Delete icon
- Always clickable and visible

### 4. **Smart Port Assignment**
- Automatic optimal port selection when dragging edges
- Based on relative positions of source and target nodes
- Horizontal connections use left/right ports
- Vertical connections use top/bottom ports

## How to Test

1. **Open the app**: http://localhost:5173/full-featured
2. **Test Auto-Layout**:
   - Press 'L' or use Layout menu
   - Try different layout types (Smart, Horizontal, Vertical, Tree, Compact)
   - Observe how edges connect to appropriate sides

3. **Test Edge Creation**:
   - Drag from any node to another
   - Notice automatic port selection based on direction
   - See how edges connect to optimal sides

4. **Test Edge Popup**:
   - Click on any edge
   - Zoom in/out with mouse wheel
   - Popup should remain at constant screen size
   - Try the icon buttons for different edge styles

5. **Test Dynamic Ports** (if using DynamicPortNode):
   - Create connections from different sides
   - Observe port color changes
   - Check port indicators when node is selected

## Known Issues Fixed
- ‚úÖ Edge popup scaling with canvas zoom
- ‚úÖ Horizontal layout using bottom connections inappropriately
- ‚úÖ Edge popup being too large with text
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation errors
