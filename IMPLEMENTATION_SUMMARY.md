# Implementation Summary - UX-Flow-Engine Fixes

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

### 1. API Gateway Service
**Status**: FIXED ‚úÖ

**Issues Fixed**:
- ‚úÖ Activated security logging middleware
- ‚úÖ Fixed password salt inconsistency (now uses env var consistently)
- ‚úÖ Fixed flow service integration (proper error handling instead of mock data)
- ‚úÖ Added proper service client parameters to function calls

**Files Modified**:
- `src/server.js` - Added SecurityLogger import and middleware activation
- `src/routes/auth.js` - Fixed salt rounds to use environment variable
- `src/routes/projects.js` - Fixed getProjectFlow to throw errors instead of returning mock data

**OPEN_QUESTIONS.md Created**: Yes

### 2. Billing Service
**Status**: PARTIALLY FIXED ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Critical Issues Fixed**:
- ‚úÖ Webhook signature verification now uses centralized StripeService
- ‚úÖ Added idempotency protection for webhooks
- ‚úÖ Added verifyWebhookSignature method to StripeService
- ‚úÖ Proper error status codes for webhook failures

**Credit Manager Improvements**:
- ‚úÖ Created `credit-manager-fixed.js` with complete solution:
  - Distributed locking to prevent race conditions
  - MongoDB transactions for atomicity
  - Idempotency keys for all operations
  - Version-based optimistic concurrency control
  - Proper session management

**Files Modified**:
- `src/routes/webhooks.js` - Fixed webhook verification
- `src/services/stripe-service.js` - Added signature verification method
- `src/services/credit-manager-fixed.js` - Complete rewrite with fixes (NEW FILE)

**Still Needs**:
- Replace old credit-manager.js with fixed version
- Add workspace access control to all billing routes
- Implement PCI compliance measures
- Add comprehensive audit logging

**OPEN_QUESTIONS.md Created**: Yes

## üîß Remaining Critical Fixes Needed

### 3. Cognitive Core Service
**Priority**: HIGH - Remove fake features

**Required Actions**:
1. Remove or implement real learning system
2. Remove random metrics generation
3. Add internationalization for prompts
4. Remove fake optimization claims
5. Update documentation to match reality

### 4. Flow Service
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Minor improvements

**Required Actions**:
1. Make hardcoded limits configurable
2. Add batch operations support
3. Add additional export formats (XML, YAML)

### 5. Knowledge Service
**Priority**: HIGH - Fix fake embeddings

**Required Actions**:
1. Implement real embedding generation (use OpenAI or similar)
2. Add proper semantic search
3. Improve caching strategy
4. Remove hash-based fake vectors

### 6. User Management Service
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Security integration

**Required Actions**:
1. Integrate PasswordManager class
2. Integrate TokenManager for JWT rotation
3. Integrate AccountLockout for brute force protection
4. Integrate TwoFactorAuth for 2FA
5. Switch from bcrypt to Argon2
